Texual Answer:

Question 1
How many child processes are created upon executing this program?
Answer:  6 child processes are created.
Represent the family tree of processes and give the output of each process.
           (Parent)
           /   |   \
        (C1)  (C2)  (C3)
              /     /  \
          (GC1)  (GC2) (GC3)
C1: i = 0
C2: i = 1
C3: i = 2
GC1: j = 0
GC2: j = 1
GC3: j = 2
